# Web Development Bootcamp - Challenge 1 

## Description 

This project presents the website of a marketing agency. It is optimized for search engines and follows accessbility standards. This was done by adding improving the title of the webpage, adding 'alt' attributes to all images and icons. 

HTML was further improved by ensuring semantic elements are found throughout the code to increase readability and HTML generally follows logical structure.

CSS structure was improved by ensuring selectors and properties are consolidated and organised and commends were added to aid understanding.
